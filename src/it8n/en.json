  "description": "I'm Padma Gnanapriya, a final-year student at the University of Kelaniya. In Sri Lanka, most students suffered from low-signal issues and a lack of high-end devices for online study during the pandemic. Apart from that, online education was not suitable for primary students, and there was very little way to interact with education.So we were not able to do some lessons online. So I'm conducting research on how to display 3D objects on websites using some alternative methods (skipping the traditional 3D web development approach) as a solution for people with low signal strength and low-end devices. My target is to find out whether this method is suitable or not for primary students and whether they can interact more than on 2D websites.",
  "thankYou": "I would appreciate it if you could spend 10 minutes providing valuable feedback on this."
